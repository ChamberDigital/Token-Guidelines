Introducing: Understanding Digital Tokens: Market Overviews & Guidelines for Policymakers & Practitioners - An Initial Step Toward Self-Governance 

The Chamber of Digital Commerce’s Token Alliance released the first edition of a comprehensive set of guidelines to help shape the responsible growth of the token and initial coin offering (ICO) markets. “Understanding Digital Tokens: Market Overviews & Guidelines for Policymakers & Practitioners” is a collaborative report to be used as a resource among industry innovators, investors and policymakers. This first installment addresses “utility tokens,” an aspect of the token economy fighting to be recognized. 

Under the leadership of former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins and former CFTC Commissioner and Chair James Newsome, the project brings together 350+ industry technologists, economists, executives, lawyers and others worldwide within the Token Alliance. The project addresses some of the ideas that are quickly coming into focus for the blockchain industry -- including the notion of self-governance for token sponsors and token trading platforms. 

This installment of the project: 
•	Provides guidelines for Token Sponsors and Token Trading Platforms for the generation and distribution of digital tokens to enable responsible governance and help to minimize fraud in the industry. 
•	Contains overviews of the laws impacting digital tokens from five countries (with more to be added in later editions). 
•	Provides a comprehensive market overview and trends analysis of the token economy.
